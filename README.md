# This is a simple maze program with function of generating a maze and search the possible path with Depth-First-Search or Breadth-First-Search algorithm

## How to use:

- Linux Version:
  - Download the `maze.cpp` file, then compile and run it: `$ g++ -o Maze Maze.cpp && ./Maze`
  - Or you can directly download the compiled 'maze' file and run it in terminal: `./maze`, possibly you need to change the authority of it to make it executable first: `$ chmod +x Maze`

- Windows Version:
  - Download the directory, choose the version if you use Visual Studio(if you don't know which to choose, then version 2010 may fit better)
  - run `maze.vcproject` or `maze.sln` with the corresponding VS, and compile then, then you may play with the maze.
  - The same as under Linux Version, you can also directly download the compiled file `maze.exe` and run it, however, it is not guaranteed that there will be no problem when running it. I suggest compiling yourself.
  - I don't use Visual Studio often, except when handing in a VS-recommended homework like this, so I compiled it in Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2015 separately, because I got problems running VS2010-compiled .exe file under my computer which installed VS2015, and the same problem occured if I swap the mode, if you have got any solution to this or have any ideas, please feel free to tell me:)
